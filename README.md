## About `geopsy-docker`

The [geopsy](https://www.geopsy.org/) suite is a powerful set of open-source tools for geophysics research,
however the installation of those tools can be challenging, especially on systems where
a user does not have root privileges. Therefore, this repository includes instructions for building
the `geospy` suite inside of a Docker containers.

The repository currently hosts instructions for:

- :white_check_mark: geopsy v3.4.2 with qt v5.14
- :white_check_mark: geopsy v2.10.1 with qt v4.8

__The pre-build images can be found on
[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jpvantassel/geopsy-docker)__.
